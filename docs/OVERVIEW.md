# Overview

Telegram Knowledge Bot is a **personal knowledge capture system** built on top of Telegram.

It allows you to save anything you want to read, watch, or reference later — without breaking your flow.

Instead of bookmarks scattered across browsers, notes apps, and chats, everything lives in **one searchable Telegram inbox**.
